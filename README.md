# Overview

In my experiences with software engineering as of now, I have had very little experience with JavaScript as a programming language. Through working on this software I hoped to both refresh my memory on what I had learned previously and fill the gaps in my knowledge of the language.

This software take a value in USD from the user and converts it into another currency based on the user's choice.

My main goal in writing this software was to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of Javascript on a webpage.

# Development Environment

For this software, I used Visual Studio Code.

I use both the JavaScript and HTML programming languages.

# Future Work



- I would like to figure out how to add a textbox on-screen for the user to enter input into rather than the pop-up I have now
- Allow the user to choose from more currency options
- Allow the user to choose what type of currency they are converting from
